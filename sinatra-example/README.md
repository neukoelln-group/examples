## Sinatra Template
This files in this folder are a starting point for using the [Sinatra library](http://sinatrarb.com). A few basic things are provided:

* All YAML files in *config/* will be loaded automatically into a hash variable called *config*.
* When you change *app.rb*, *config.ru* or any of the config YAML files, the Sinatra app will automatically be restarted.
* [HAML](http://haml.info) is provided as the templating language
* All the views use a basic layout which tells the browser to use HTML 5
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) is provided for styling the page - the layout wraps everything in a div.container element
